/**
 * The "two-factor was turned off" security alert, in English and Thai
 * (US-SET-03).
 *
 * This is identity mail: it goes to the account holder about their own account,
 * so it is UNCONDITIONAL and consults no template catalog. An organizer may
 * switch off the workspace's attendee templates; they may not switch off
 * somebody's security correspondence, because the person whose second factor
 * was removed by an intruder is precisely the person an organizer's template
 * setting must not be able to silence.
 *
 * The alert matters most when the reader did NOT do this, which decides the
 * shape of the copy: it reports the change, stamps WHEN it happened so the
 * reader can match it against what they remember doing, and then says what to
 * do if it was not them. It deliberately contains no link. Everything a
 * compromised account needs — a new password, a new second factor — happens
 * behind a sign-in, and a security alert that trains people to click a link in
 * a security alert is the phishing lure it was meant to warn them about.
 *
 * What it does NOT say is the device and IP address, although the sign-in
 * notice genre usually carries them: `identity.two_factor_disabled` does not
 * carry either field (see eventa-api's
 * `auth-two-factor/events/two-factor-disabled.event.ts`), and inventing a
 * "unknown device" line would be worse than silence on a security alert.
 *
 * THE "NO LINK" CLAIM IS ENFORCED, NOT MERELY INTENDED. The reader's name is
 * the one piece of free text here, and the session that can set it is the
 * stolen one this alert reports — so it goes through `safeDisplayName` before
 * it is greeted with, and the greeting drops it entirely rather than print
 * anything that is not shaped like a name. Without that, a profile renamed to
 * "Somchai\n\nURGENT: … https://evil.test/fix" would put an attacker's line,
 * and an attacker's clickable host, above Eventa's own warning — and a profile
 * renamed to "Support +66 81 234 5678" would put an attacker's PHONE NUMBER
 * there, which a phone linkifies into `tel:` with no URL punctuation at all.
 * The claim is about what the reader's client does with the text, not only
 * about what this file writes into it.

/**
 * The copy for a locale, falling back rather than returning `undefined`.

 * `COPY` is a `Record<Locale, Copy>` and `notice.locale` is typed `Locale`, so
 * indexing it looks total — and is not. This service only MIRRORS eventa-api's
 * `locale` pgEnum and Drizzle maps no enum values on the way in, so a language
 * added upstream arrives as a string this table has no key for. Indexing it
 * then threw a `TypeError` while building the subject, BEFORE the send and
 * without the warn line or counter a failed READ would have produced: the
 * alert rode the retry ladder into the dead-letter queue in silence.
 *
 * `common/messaging/locale.ts` coerces the value where it enters from the
 * database, which fixes the path that actually broke. This is the second
 * guard, here because this file is what indexes the table: no caller, present
 * or future, should be able to turn a language it has not heard of into a
 * person not hearing about their own account.
